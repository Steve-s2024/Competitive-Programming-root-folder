        # for the example case of nums = [6, 3, 3, 2], k = 1
        # before any operation, the product of nums is 6*3*3*2, call it oldProd
        # 
        # if choose to increase the first element, the final result will be: oldProd with an increase of (oldProd/firstElement) 
        # why the increase (oldProd/firstElement)? it comes from (6+1)*3*3*2, which is the new product,  
        # subtract 6*3*3*2, which is the old product.
        #
        # the above observation can be expand to --> if choose to increase the ith element, the result
        # will be --> oldProd + (oldProd/nums[i])

        # observe that to maximize the result, oldProd is constant, so we minimize nums[i].
        # in another word, spend the operation on increasing the min(nums)

        # for cases that k > 1, I didn't spend time to prove it, but my greedy solution worked...
